For A1, we'll design an animation that includes a fish, a man without arms, two stones, and seaweed. In this assignment, I misestimated the time required and I didn't get a chance to solve the problem of the object moving. In this assignment, I have completed drawings of figures, fish, stones, backgrounds, ground, seaweed and human breathing bubbles. But I don't have time to complete the movement of these objects. I drew some twisted seagrass because I wanted to mimic the way the seagrass swayed in the water. I don't have time to find a better way to draw human feet, so I can only use small squares instead. I want to change the colour of the objects to make them more like a video, but the result is a bit different. I guess this shouldn't be a big deal. I've never understood javascript before, so this time a lot of code I didn't have time to understand. Next time I will start the assignment earlier to give myself more time to finish.I didn't change the size of the scene I think the initial size should be 512x512.
